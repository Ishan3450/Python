# tableOf7 = [str(i*7) for i in range(1,11)]
# verFormat = "\n".join(tableOf7)
# print(verFormat)

# Fourth Question

# l = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,90,0,12,3235,456,345,54,6345,25,346,5,45,52,41,5,457,24,1]

# def divBy5(num):
# 	if(num%5==0):
# 		return True
# 	else:
# 		return False

# print(list(filter(divBy5,l)))

# Sixth Question

# from functools import reduce
# l = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# print(reduce(max,l))

# Seventh Question
